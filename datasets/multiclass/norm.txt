Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from .
Airbus offers a 10-abreast A350 but says it has not yet sold it .
Airbus says it has commissioned research suggesting an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent .
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s , when the average girth of the newly christened &quot; jet set &quot; was narrower .
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch-wide economy seat laid out 9 abreast .
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide in economy cabins , but its U.S. arch-rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide .

Airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008 .
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi use at cruising altitudes to passengers for several years .
Airlines pay online travel sellers such as Orbitz $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold .
Airlines will have to show the FAA how their airplanes meet the new guidelines and that they &apos;ve updating their flight crew training manuals and rules for stowing devices to reflect the new guidelines .

Boeing &apos;s performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10-abreast 777X with an original 9-abreast 777 design .
Boeing disputes Airbus &apos;s figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities .
Boeing says its revamped &quot; 777X &quot; will hold 406 people based on economy seats more than 17 inches wide and set out 10 in each row .

Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engined long-haul designs than the market leader in that segment , the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER .
Both communities are thus mentioned in the same deed .

Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are engaged in an ongoing battle against the drug cartels .

Dick &apos;s tale acts as a blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the phone tapping madness of the NSA .
dickens
Dick had &apos; God experiences &apos; , and his later books read like a mixture of the Book of Revelation and a computer manual .
Dick illustrates America - the kingdom of breathtaking technical progress , paired with paranoia , a fixation on security and the belief of having been chosen .

Ditta , 42 , fed information to criminals because of fears his cocaine addiction would be exposed
Ditta denied wrongdoing and claimed: &quot; If I was a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and I wanted to feed information to Mr Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , I would do it immediately . &quot;
Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to &quot; legal privilege . &quot;

Due to the elaborate configuration of the tunnel , investigators are working on the assumption that it was build by architects and engineers and that the construction took around one year .
Due to the low level of sunshine , from autumn until spring the village of Rjukan in the Vestfjord valley normally languishes in the shadows of the surrounding mountains .
Due to the political unrest in the country , it has not been possible to make as many journeys as planned , but for this reason , many local doctors have come to Germany , to sit in on lectures on a variety of topics .

Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $ 100 for passengers to store carry-on luggage on board their flight .
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $ 100 for a carry-on bag and $ 2 for coffee or soda , although its announcement on Wednesday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can .
Frontier Airlines to charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier &apos;s move to charge the carry-on fee if passengers don &apos;t buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to steer customers toward its own website .
Frontier &apos;s new carry-on fee won &apos;t start until summer , though a date hasn &apos;t been set .
Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Denver , but its business is shrinking and losing money .
Frontier has gone the furthest in this area , though .
Frontier is also following Spirit &apos;s $ 2 charge for coffee , tea , soda , or juice .
Frontier said it will charge $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance , $ 100 if travelers wait to pay until they &apos;re at the gate .
Frontier said passengers who get soda or juice can keep the whole can , and it will give coffee refills for free .
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O &apos;Malley said the $ 100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance .

Passengers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane descends to land and not restart them until the plane is on the ground .
Passengers can already do this during the bulk of a flight but many people find it annoying to be unable to access their e-books during take-offs and landings .
Passengers often grumble about baggage charges and other fees , but airlines love them .
Passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stuffing as much as they can into carry-on baggage stashed in overhead bins , meaning those bins often run out of space .
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline &apos;s website won &apos;t have to pay .
Passengers will be told to switch their smartphones , tablets and other devices to airplane mode .

&quot; The prosecution suggests that Mr Coulson , who is now the editor of the NotW , he is not the man who stands outside people &apos;s houses hoping to catch them out , he is the man who likes to put the story to people to see what they will say , &quot; Mr Edis said .
&quot; There are only two words for it: Really good , &quot; he stated .
&quot; There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed , &quot; he said .
&quot; The reason Boeing are doing this is to cram more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products , &quot; said Kevin Keniston , head of passenger comfort at Europe &apos;s Airbus .
&quot; The reason we are here is that the Labor State Government ripped $ 430 million out of its health system , &quot; he told ABC TV .
&quot; There is currently a dangerous trend , with Mane and Alan being dubbed as &apos; divers &apos; , &quot; he said at a press conference in Salburg on Thursday , in defence of the two tricky offensive players .
&quot; There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin , &quot; said Randy Rentschler , the commission &apos;s director of legislation and public affairs .

&quot; They absolutely think their son was murdered , &quot; Benjamin Crump , an attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson , told FoxNews.com.
&quot; They are beating drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work , &quot; Bwelle said .
&quot; They believe that it defies logic , the laws of physics as well as common sense , &quot; Crump said .
&quot; They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short term for business ventures or investments , or small businesses with a need to tide over their cash flow needs , &quot; says Ms Yeah .
&quot; They sent their son to school with a book-bag and he was returned to them in a body bag , &quot; he said .
&quot; They will know if they start smoking again , they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine , and that can help them kick the habit , &quot; he said .
&quot; They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene , &quot; said Kaplowitz .
&quot; This expense has now been offloaded , &quot; Maier was glad to say .
&quot; This has been a topic for many years and hasn &apos;t fundamentally changed through the current discussion , &quot; says Kurt Bock , chief executive of chemical maker BASF .
&quot; This is mainly due to the higher contribution from the administrative budget , &quot; said Rothmund .
&quot; This is not just a tax going into a black hole , &quot; said Adrian Moore , vice president of policy at Reason .
&quot; This law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it , &quot; said Cyrus Kamau , managing director for Capital Group - home to CapitalFM , one of Kenya &apos;s most respected independent radio stations and news websites .
&quot; This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier &apos;s internal schedule apparently - reinforces our view that entry-into-service will be pushed to Q1 / 15 , &quot; said Doerksen .
&quot; This will change my future with my family , &quot; the man said .
&quot; This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term , &quot; he said .
&quot; Today , the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom , a genuine democracy and stability , &quot; said Morsi , a 60-year-old US-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that has spent most of the 84 years since its inception as an outlawed organisation harshly targeted by successive governments .

&quot; We are now in the Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
&quot; We are receiving 500 people in each trip , &quot; Bwelle said .
&quot; We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to stop , exhausting all the methods on the market today , but find their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches , &quot; Prof Cornell said .
&quot; We are working on the assumption of an increase of 1 cent plus x , &quot; said Bias , with the figure likely to be closer to 2 cents .
&quot; We arrest individuals who &apos;ve broken no law , &quot; says the government official .
&quot; We aspire to a better tomorrow , a new Egypt and a second republic , &quot; Morsi said during a solemn ceremony shown live on state television .
&quot; We don &apos;t want to charge that , &quot; she said .
&quot; We get to them first , before they can commit an act of violence &quot; .
&quot; We have to address the subject of municipal rates , as there are investments to be made in the coming years for which we could do with subsidies , &quot; commented Gerster regarding this matter .
&quot; We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty , &quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children &apos;s Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .
&quot; We need to have a better system , &quot; he said .
&quot; We seek no reward , except the reward of history that we can at a critical time serve this community , &quot; he said .
&quot; We want peace back; we want stability , &quot; said Vanessa de Sousa , chief executive of an investment company .
&quot; We want to involve the residents in the planning at as early a stage as possible , &quot; said Mayor Jens Häußler , opening the citizen &apos;s information event regarding the flood protection concept in Gechingen .
&quot; We will not participate in the wild card process , &quot; said former national team player Pascal Roller , who has been putting together the concept for a professional club in the Hansa town since 2012 .
&quot; We will shortly make a decision regarding whether he will play , &quot; said manager Thomas Tuchel .
&quot; We would welcome a review by CASA into allowing the use of electronic devices because we really do think it will improve the customer experience now that we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) on our planes , &quot; a spokesman said .
&quot; What &apos;s innovative about it is that the six-month courses end with diplomas , &quot; said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg Employment Agency .
&quot; While there is considerable evidence from many different mammals that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes , much of the detail still has to be hammered out - and dogs are no exception , &quot; he said .
&quot; While the weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated , we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation , &quot; Doerksen said in a client note .
&quot; While we can amend our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans , they also need to come to terms with the fact that we &apos;re not the only ones that are out there spying , &quot; Murphy said .
&quot; Why is this ? &quot; I ask myself .
&quot; Without support from their employer , the resulting burden placed on employees could result in the termination of the employment contract , &quot; said Wolf .
&quot; Year-to-date , our 10 countries are profitable and several are on track for record full-year earnings before interest and tax contributions , &quot; he said .
&quot; You &apos;re going to get a better deal , &quot; he said .
&quot; You must continue to be tenacious and make sure that local public transport becomes even better , &quot; he explained in the address given to the local politicians in attendance .

Rather , he said , their friendships with Lord clouded their judgements about reporting him .
Rather than being rattled by the U.S. government shutdown , investors kept their focus on what probably matters more: the Federal Reserve .
Rather , the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters - something German politicians want to keep .

Renamo &apos;s share of the vote has been declining since 1992 , while a newer party , the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) which was formed by a former Renamo member , is expected to improve its showing at the elections .
Renamo says the government initiated the latest clashes by launching an attack on its members in Sofala province , traditionally a Renamo stronghold , on October 17 .
Renamo wanted to &quot; warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique , &quot; Mr Mazanga said .
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa &apos;s apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilise the country &apos;s independent government .
Renamo , which has been pushing for electoral reforms , had already said that it would boycott municipal elections due in November .
